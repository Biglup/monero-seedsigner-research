# Monero SeedSigner research spike: report

Status: stage 1 in progress. Sections marked "pending" are not yet measured.

## 1. Summary

Pending.

## 2. Measurements

Pending (see SPEC.md section 5 for the table layout).

## 3. Findings

Format survey (2026-09-17, before any fixtures exist), full detail in
`xmr-signer/FORMATS.md`:

- The four Keystone UR types are bare CBOR byte strings around wallet2's own
  cold-signing blobs (magic prefix + view-key encryption + monero binary_archive).
  There is no Keystone-specific structure to implement; the work is wallet2 format
  compatibility.
- Every payload is encrypted with ChaCha20 under a key that is CryptoNight v0 of the
  view secret key, and authenticated with a Monero Schnorr signature by the view key.
  The device must run CryptoNight once per payload; its ARMv6 cost is a stage 1
  measurement.
- Under today's protocol the cold side constructs the entire transaction, including
  the Bulletproof+ range proof and all CLSAGs, from ring data supplied by the hot
  wallet. The fee is implied by amounts, not passed. This rules out monero-oxide's
  high-level `SignableTransaction` builder (fee-rate driven) and means building the
  transaction from its primitives, which monero-oxide does expose.
- Feather can save every payload to a file (outputs, key images, unsigned tx via the
  advanced send dialog, signed tx) and import all three replies from a file, so stage 1
  runs without a camera. Feather can also act as the cold wallet, giving reference
  blobs for the same fixtures.
- Feather 2.8.1 mac-arm64 release verified: GPG signature good from the FeatherWallet
  key shipped in the Feather repository (fingerprint ending CEFBA71C), sha256
  a35f19be74ca59bad96f7331d3ca8e4f56ec47e82c193f5fc50ddbebce017233.
- Cupcake handles the same four UR type strings and delegates to monero_c (wallet2),
  so unchanged compatibility is expected; verified only in stage 2.
- The hot wallet in the Feather wizard must be view-only. A Feather wallet that
  holds the spend key already knows every key image, so its default outputs export
  (`all = false`, unknown key images only) is empty and the round trip is
  meaningless. The demo and the fixtures use a Feather wallet restored from the
  primary address and the private view key.
- Output history is built by self-sends from monero-wallet-rpc 0.18.5.1 on the same
  seed (`xmr-signer/scripts/fanout.py`): each transaction pays 15 own subaddresses
  plus change, 16 owned outputs per transaction, waiting ten blocks between rounds.
  Spent outputs still count for the view-only export, so the 50, 200 and 500
  snapshots are taken from one wallet as its history grows.
- Frame counts: Feather emits 150-byte fragments at 80 ms; the SeedSigner shell
  displays 30-byte fragments at its default density (10 low, 120 high).

## 4. Decision record

### Rust (monero-oxide) vs C++ (wallet2): Rust

Day-one gate, 2026-09-17. monero-oxide's `monero-wallet` crate (commit
731657ae3385be667abb556266369a497bc86f13, default branch) cross-compiles to a
static `arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf` binary with cargo-zigbuild (zig
0.15.2, rustc 1.96.0 (ac68faa20 2026-05-25)) and runs on the Pi Zero 1.3 (BCM2835,
kernel 6.18.50+rpt-rpi-v6, 437132 kB MemTotal). The gate binary
`xmr-signer/crates/xmr-gate` computed 5120 key images (20 passes over the 256
`generate_key_image` vectors from monero-project/monero) with 0 mismatches,
median 3891 us per key image, peak RSS 1488 kB. Raw output:
`xmr-signer/dist/pi-gate-results.txt`. The C++ wallet2 fallback was not
needed and was not attempted.

### Pi Zero 1.3 vs Pi Zero 2 W: Pi Zero 1.3

Kept. The gate ran natively on ARMv6 in the target memory budget, so there is
no reason to move to aarch64. Reconsider only if signing at 16 inputs turns
out to exceed the budget in stage 1 step 4.

### Benchmark transport

The Pi Zero 1.3 has no network. Benchmarks run on a Raspberry Pi OS card with
the USB port in gadget mode over a single cable; see `xmr-signer/PI_RUN.md`.
This is measurement infrastructure, not part of the device image.
